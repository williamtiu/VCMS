# Notes:
# - sqlite3 is a built-in Python module and not listed here.
# - typing_extensions might be pulled in by various libraries, especially for
#   compatibility with older Python versions. If specific features from it are
#   used directly, it could be pinned. For now, assume it's a transitive dependency.
# - This list is an estimation based on common dependencies. A `pip freeze`
#   in a clean virtual environment after `pip install -r old_requirements.txt`
#   would provide the exact set.
